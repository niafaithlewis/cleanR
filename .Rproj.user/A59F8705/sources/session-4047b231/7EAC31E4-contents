\title{Plants Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 10 rows and 9 columns:
\describe{
\item{treatment}{Factor indicating the treatment the plant is subjected to. "d" indicates drought, "w" indicates well-watered or control.}
\item{pot_id}{Character string describing the ID of the individual plant.}
\item{line}{Character variable indicating the artificial selection line the plant belongs to (e.g. "SC1" : self-compatible (the plant has been bred to be able to reproduce with itself), SI1 : self-incompatible (the plant cannot reproduce with itself), C : control).}
\item{mom}{Numeric variable for the ID of the plant used as the ovule donor (Mom)}
\item{dad}{Numeric variable for the ID of the plant used as the pollen donor (Dad).}
\item{tray_id}{Numeric variable indicating the location of the plant in the greenhouse.}
\item{target_weight}{Numeric variable for the target weight of the plant in grams}
\item{X10_6_weight}{Numeric variable for the plant's weight in grams on October 6 (2024).}
\item{X10_9_weight}{Numeric variable for the plant's weight in grams on October 9 (2024).}

\source{
Data generated from an experiment currently being done by Nia Faith Lewis,
on plant reproductive responses to drought-induced environmental stress.

\usage{
data(plants_clean)

# Identifying Typos in Text Data

In this vignette, we will explore how to use the `identify_typos` function from the `cleanR` package to identify potential typos in text data based on string lengths and string distances.

## Introduction

When working with textual data, it's common to encounter typos, inconsistencies, or other data quality issues. The `identify_typos` function can help identify these potential errors using two main approaches:
1. **String length**: Words that deviate significantly in length from the average or most frequent length are flagged.
2. **String distance**: Words that are similar to other words but not identical (based on Jaro-Winkler distance) are flagged.

## Function Overview

The function `identify_typos` checks for two types of issues in text data:
- **Length deviations**: Words whose lengths differ from the typical length in the data.
- **String distances**: Words that are close in spelling to others.

### Parameters:
- `data`: A character vector or a column from a dataframe containing the text data to check.
- `length_threshold`: The threshold for length deviations. Words with a length difference greater than this threshold are flagged.
- `distance_threshold`: The Jaro-Winkler string distance threshold for identifying similar words.

## Example Usage

### Loading the Data

Let's first load a sample dataset to demonstrate the function:

```{r}
library(cleanR)

# Sample data
plants_clean <- read.csv("/cloud/project/cleanR/data-raw/plants_test.csv")

# Preview the data
head(plants_clean)


# Identify typos in the 'treatment' column
potential_typos <- identify_typos(plants_clean$treatment)

# Print the result
print(potential_typos)


# Example data with potential typos
data <- c("d", "dry", "w", "wet", "d", "w", "dr", "d")

# Identify typos in the custom data
potential_typos <- identify_typos(data)

# Print the result
print(potential_typos)
